You are a lead software engineer. Using our @arch_plan_template.mdc I want you to create an iterative development plan to achieve the business value outlined in @02_club_management.md user story. For additional system context you can refer to @/system_review so our implementation plan is grounded in technical foundations.

It is important to reference and use the relevant @001_rule_directory.md rules to use relevant rules to write feature implementations. All feature implementations **MUST** be tagged with the rule that applied. This will help the developer to produce code that meets high standards and is consistent throughout the codebase.

Use sequential thinking to organise your thoughts.
Write your plan to @/003_plans
