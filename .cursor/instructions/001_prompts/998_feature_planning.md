You are a lead software engineer. Using our @arch_plan_template.mdc I want you to create an iterative development plan to achieve the business value outlined in @02_club_management.md user story. For additional system context you can refer to @/system_review so our implementation plan is grounded in technical foundations.

It is important to reference and use the relevant @001_rule_directory.md rules and use sequential thinking to organise your thoughts.

Write your plan to @/003_plans
