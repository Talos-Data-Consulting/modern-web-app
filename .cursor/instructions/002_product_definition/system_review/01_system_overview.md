## Data Flow Overview

### 1. Data Entry

- Athletes are created either individually or via CSV upload
- Performances are recorded with automatic validation
- Competitions and medals are tracked with event details

### 2. Data Processing

- System automatically calculates club records and personal bests
- Performance comparisons determine record status
- Data validation ensures integrity across all operations

### 3. Data Presentation

- Performance grids display filterable, sortable data
- Record views highlight current and historical achievements
- Export functionality provides data for external analysis

## Key Business Rules

### Performance Rules

- Each performance must belong to an athlete, discipline, and age group
- Performances can have either a measured result or medal (or both)
- Team disciplines require appropriate team member selection
- Duplicate performances (same athlete, discipline, date, event) are prevented

### Record Management Rules

- Club records are automatically calculated per discipline, age group, and gender
- Personal bests are career-wide, not age-group specific
- Record status is cached for performance but historical flags are maintained
- Team disciplines do not generate personal bests

### Multi-Club Rules

- Each club maintains independent records and athlete lists
- Users can switch between clubs via session management
- Age groups are club-specific configurations
- Data isolation ensures club privacy

## System Integrations

### External Dependencies
