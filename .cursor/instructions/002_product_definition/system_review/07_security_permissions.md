# Security Model & User Permissions

## Overview

The TrackRecord system implements a comprehensive security model designed to protect sensitive athletics data while providing appropriate access levels for different user types. The security architecture follows Django best practices with additional custom implementations for multi-club data isolation.

## Authentication System

### User Authentication Framework

#### Django Authentication Integration

- **Framework**: Built on Django's robust authentication system
- **Session Management**: Server-side session storage with secure cookies
- **Password Security**: PBKDF2 password hashing with salt
- **Login Protection**: Custom login view with enhanced security features

#### Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant L as Login View
    participant A as Auth System
    participant S as Session Store
    participant D as Database

    U->>L: Submit login credentials
    L->>A: Validate credentials
    A->>D: Query user data
    D-->>A: Return user info
    A->>A: Verify password hash
    A->>S: Create session
    S-->>A: Session ID
    A->>L: Authentication result
    L-->>U: Set session cookie + redirect
```

### Session Management

#### Session Security

- **Secure Cookies**: Session cookies marked as secure and HTTP-only
- **Session Timeout**: Configurable session timeout for security
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery protection on all forms
- **Session Invalidation**: Proper session cleanup on logout

#### Club Context Management

- **Multi-Club Sessions**: Sessions maintain current club context
- **Club Switching**: Secure club switching with validation
- **Context Isolation**: All queries filtered by session club context
- **Permission Inheritance**: Club-specific permissions applied automatically

## Authorization & Access Control

### User Role Hierarchy

#### 1. Anonymous Users

- **Access Level**: Read-only public data
- **Permissions**:
  - View club records (filtered by club context)
  - Browse athlete profiles (public information only)
  - View discipline and season information
  - Access public statistics and summaries
- **Restrictions**:
  - Cannot create, edit, or delete any data
  - Cannot access file uploads or downloads
  - Cannot view sensitive athlete information

#### 2. Authenticated Users

- **Access Level**: Full club-specific data access
- **Permissions**:
  - Create and manage performances
  - Create and manage athletes within their club
  - Upload and download performance proof files
  - Access detailed athlete performance data
  - Use all interactive features and forms
- **Restrictions**:
  - Limited to their assigned club's data
  - Cannot access administrative functions
  - Cannot perform bulk operations

#### 3. Staff Users

- **Access Level**: Administrative capabilities within club context
- **Permissions**:
  - All authenticated user permissions
  - Bulk athlete uploads via CSV
  - Administrative data management
  - Access to advanced reporting features
  - System configuration within club scope
- **Restrictions**:
  - Still limited to club-specific data
  - Cannot access Django admin interface
  - Cannot modify system-wide settings

#### 4. Superusers

- **Access Level**: Complete system administration
- **Permissions**:
  - Full access to Django admin interface
  - Cross-club data access and management
  - System-wide configuration and settings
  - User management and role assignment
  - Complete database access and modification
- **Restrictions**:
  - None - complete system access

### Permission Implementation

#### View-Level Security

```python
# Example permission checking pattern
@login_required
def create_performance(request):
    # Club context automatically applied
    # User permissions validated
    # Data access restricted to user's club
```

#### Model-Level Security

- **Automatic Filtering**: All queries automatically filtered by club context
- **Permission Decorators**: Views protected with appropriate decorators
- **Custom Middleware**: Club context middleware ensures data isolation
- **Access Validation**: Every data access validated against user permissions

## Data Access Control

### Club Data Isolation

#### Multi-Club Architecture

- **Complete Isolation**: Each club's data completely isolated from others
- **Context Enforcement**: Club context enforced at middleware level
- **Query Filtering**: All database queries automatically filtered by club
- **Session Binding**: Club context bound to user session

#### Club Switching Security

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User requests club switch] --> B[Validate user has access to target club]
    B --> C{Access granted?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Update session club context]
    C -->|No| E[Deny access & log attempt]
    D --> F[Redirect to same page with new context]
    E --> G[Show error message]
    F --> H[All subsequent queries use new club context]
```

### File Access Security

#### Performance Proof Files

- **Secure Storage**: Files stored outside web root with secure paths
- **Access Validation**: File access validated against user permissions
- **Club Context**: File access restricted to appropriate club members
- **Download Security**: Secure download mechanism with permission checks

#### File Upload Security

- **Type Validation**: Only allowed file types accepted
- **Size Limits**: File size restrictions prevent abuse
- **Malware Scanning**: Basic security scanning for uploaded files
- **Secure Naming**: Files renamed with secure, unique identifiers

## Security Measures

### Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Form Security

- **CSRF Protection**: All forms protected against CSRF attacks
- **Input Sanitization**: All user input sanitized and validated
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Django ORM prevents SQL injection
- **XSS Protection**: Template system prevents cross-site scripting

#### File Upload Security

- **File Type Validation**: Strict file type checking
- **Content Validation**: File content validation beyond extension
- **Size Restrictions**: Maximum file size limits
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in secure locations

### Transport Security

#### HTTPS Enforcement

- **SSL/TLS**: All communications encrypted with HTTPS
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers prevent clickjacking and XSS
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict Transport Security enforced
- **Certificate Validation**: Proper SSL certificate validation

#### Cookie Security

- **Secure Flags**: Session cookies marked as secure
