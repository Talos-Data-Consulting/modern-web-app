# User Story 03: User Roles & Permissions

**Priority**: Critical (Foundation)
**Epic**: Core System Foundation
**Story Points**: 6

## User Story

As a **system administrator**, I want to **manage user roles and permissions** so that I can **control access to different system features based on user responsibilities**.

## Business Value

- Ensures appropriate access control for different user types
- Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access
- Supports different organizational roles within clubs
- Enables secure delegation of administrative tasks

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Anonymous User Access

- **Given** an anonymous (non-logged-in) user
- **When** they access the system
- **Then** they should only see public club records and general information
- **And** should not be able to create, edit, or delete any data
- **And** should not see sensitive athlete information

### AC2: Authenticated User Permissions

- **Given** a logged-in authenticated user
- **When** they access the system
- **Then** they should have full read access to their club's data
- **And** be able to create and manage performances
- **And** be able to create and manage athletes
- **And** be able to upload and download performance proof files
- **And** be restricted to their club's data only

### AC3: Staff User Permissions

- **Given** a user with staff privileges
- **When** they access the system
- **Then** they should have all authenticated user permissions
- **And** be able to perform bulk athlete uploads via CSV
- **And** have access to administrative data management features
- **And** be able to access advanced reporting features
- **And** still be limited to their club's data

### AC4: Superuser Permissions

- **Given** a superuser
- **When** they access the system
- **Then** they should have complete system access
- **And** be able to access the Django admin interface
- **And** be able to view and manage data across all clubs
- **And** be able to manage user accounts and permissions
- **And** have access to system-wide configuration

### AC5: Permission Enforcement

- **Given** a user attempts to access a feature
- **When** they don't have the required permissions
- **Then** they should be denied access with a clear error message
- **And** the attempt should be logged for security monitoring
- **And** they should be redirected to an appropriate page

## Technical Requirements

### System References

- **Security Model**: `07_security_permissions.md` - Complete permission system
- **User Flows**: `03_user_flows.md` - Authentication and authorization flows
- **Data Models**: `02_data_models.md` - User model with role flags

### Implementation Details

- Django's built-in User model with is_staff and is_superuser flags
- Permission decorators on views
- Template-based permission checking
- Middleware for automatic permission enforcement
- Role-based access control patterns

### Database Requirements

- User model with is_staff and is_superuser boolean fields
- User-club relationships for club-specific access
- Permission logging for audit trails

## BDD Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Anonymous User Access

```gherkin
Feature: User Roles and Permissions
  As a system administrator
  I want to control access based on user roles
  So that data security is maintained

  Scenario: Anonymous user viewing public data
    Given I am not logged in
    When I visit the club records page
    Then I should see public club records
    And I should not see any "Create" or "Edit" buttons
    And I should not see sensitive athlete information

  Scenario: Anonymous user blocked from protected features
    Given I am not logged in
    When I try to access the "Create Performance" page
    Then I should be redirected to the login page
    And I should see "Please log in to access this feature"
```

### Scenario 2: Authenticated User Permissions

```gherkin
  Scenario: Authenticated user accessing club data
    Given I am logged in as a regular user for "Springfield Athletics Club"
    When I visit the athletes page
    Then I should see all athletes from "Springfield Athletics Club"
    And I should see "Create Athlete" button
    And I should not see athletes from other clubs

  Scenario: Authenticated user creating performance
    Given I am logged in as a regular user
    When I access the "Create Performance" page
    Then I should see the performance creation form
    And I should be able to submit valid performance data
    And the performance should be saved successfully
```

### Scenario 3: Staff User Permissions

```gherkin
  Scenario: Staff user accessing bulk upload
    Given I am logged in as a staff user
    When I navigate to the athlete management section
    Then I should see the "Bulk Upload Athletes" option
    And I should be able to access the CSV upload interface

  Scenario: Staff user blocked from admin interface
    Given I am logged in as a staff user
    When I try to access the Django admin interface
    Then I should be denied access
    And I should see "You don't have permission to access this area"
```

### Scenario 4: Superuser Permissions

```gherkin
  Scenario: Superuser accessing admin interface
    Given I am logged in as a superuser
    When I navigate to the Django admin interface
    Then I should have full access to all admin functions
    And I should be able to view and edit all system data

  Scenario: Superuser cross-club access
    Given I am logged in as a superuser
    When I switch between different clubs
    Then I should be able to access data from all clubs
    And I should see data from multiple clubs in admin views
```

### Scenario 5: Permission Enforcement

```gherkin
  Scenario: Regular user blocked from staff features
    Given I am logged in as a regular user
    When I try to access the bulk athlete upload feature
    Then I should see a "Permission Denied" error
    And I should be redirected to the home page
    And the attempt should be logged

  Scenario: Staff user blocked from superuser features
    Given I am logged in as a staff user
    When I try to access cross-club data management
    Then I should see a "Permission Denied" error
    And I should only see data from my assigned club
```

### Scenario 6: Role-Based UI Elements

```gherkin
  Scenario: UI elements based on permissions
    Given I am logged in as a regular user
    When I view any page
    Then I should only see UI elements appropriate for my role
    And I should not see admin-only buttons or links

  Scenario: Staff user sees additional options
    Given I am logged in as a staff user
    When I view the athlete management page
    Then I should see additional administrative options
    And I should see the bulk upload functionality
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Anonymous users can view public data only
- [ ] Authenticated users have appropriate club-specific permissions
- [ ] Staff users have extended administrative capabilities
- [ ] Superusers have complete system access
- [ ] Permission checks are enforced at view level
- [ ] UI elements are shown/hidden based on permissions
- [ ] Permission violations are logged for security
- [ ] All BDD scenarios pass
- [ ] Role-based access is consistent across all features
- [ ] Error messages are clear and user-friendly
