# User Story 01: User Authentication System

**Priority**: Critical (Foundation)
**Epic**: Core System Foundation
**Story Points**: 8

## User Story

As a **club administrator or member**, I want to **securely log into the TrackRecord system** so that I can **access club-specific athletics data and manage performances**.

## Business Value

- Enables secure access to sensitive athletics data
- Provides foundation for all other system features
- Ensures data privacy and compliance
- Supports multi-club architecture

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: User Login

- **Given** a user with valid credentials
- **When** they enter their username and password on the login page
- **Then** they should be successfully authenticated and redirected to the home page
- **And** their session should be established with appropriate permissions

### AC2: Invalid Login Handling

- **Given** a user enters invalid credentials
- **When** they attempt to login
- **Then** they should see a clear error message
- **And** remain on the login page to retry
- **And** the system should log the failed attempt

### AC3: Session Management

- **Given** an authenticated user
- **When** they are inactive for the configured timeout period
- **Then** their session should expire
- **And** they should be redirected to the login page for subsequent requests

### AC4: Secure Logout

- **Given** an authenticated user
- **When** they click the logout button
- **Then** their session should be terminated
- **And** they should be redirected to the login page
- **And** all session data should be cleared

### AC5: Access Control

- **Given** an unauthenticated user
- **When** they try to access protected pages
- **Then** they should be redirected to the login page
- **And** after successful login, redirected to their intended page

## Technical Requirements

### System References

- **Security Model**: `07_security_permissions.md` - Authentication System
- **User Flows**: `03_user_flows.md` - User Authentication Flow
- **API Endpoints**: `06_api_endpoints.md` - Login/Logout endpoints

### Implementation Details

- Django's built-in authentication system
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- CSRF protection on all forms
- HTTPS enforcement for all authentication requests
- Password hashing using PBKDF2 with salt

### Database Requirements

- User model with username, email, password fields
- is_staff and is_superuser flags for role-based access
- Session storage for authentication state

## BDD Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Successful User Login

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a club member
  I want to log into the system
  So that I can access club data

  Scenario: Valid user login
    Given I am on the login page
    And I have a valid user account with username "clubuser" and password "secure123"
    When I enter "clubuser" in the username field
    And I enter "secure123" in the password field
    And I click the "Login" button
    Then I should be redirected to the home page
    And I should see "Welcome" in the page header
    And my session should be established
```

### Scenario 2: Invalid Login Attempt

```gherkin
  Scenario: Invalid user login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter "invaliduser" in the username field
    And I enter "wrongpassword" in the password field
    And I click the "Login" button
    Then I should remain on the login page
    And I should see "Invalid username or password" error message
    And no session should be established
```

### Scenario 3: Session Timeout

```gherkin
  Scenario: Session expires after inactivity
    Given I am logged in as "clubuser"
    And I have been inactive for 30 minutes
    When I try to access any protected page
    Then I should be redirected to the login page
    And I should see "Your session has expired" message
```

### Scenario 4: Secure Logout

```gherkin
  Scenario: User logout
    Given I am logged in as "clubuser"
    And I am on the home page
    When I click the "Logout" button
    Then I should be redirected to the login page
    And my session should be terminated
    And I should not be able to access protected pages
```

### Scenario 5: Protected Page Access

```gherkin
  Scenario: Unauthenticated user tries to access protected page
    Given I am not logged in
    When I try to access "/records/performances/new/"
    Then I should be redirected to the login page
    And the next parameter should be set to "/records/performances/new/"

  Scenario: Redirect after login
    Given I was redirected to login from "/records/performances/new/"
    When I successfully log in
    Then I should be redirected to "/records/performances/new/"
```
