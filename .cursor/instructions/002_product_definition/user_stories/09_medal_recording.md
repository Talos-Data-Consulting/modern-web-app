### Scenario 1: Medal Ceremony Planning

```gherkin
Feature: Medal Ceremony Management
  As a club administrator
  I want to plan recognition ceremonies
  So that I can celebrate athlete achievements

  Scenario: Plan annual awards ceremony
    Given I am logged in as a staff user
    And there are athletes with medal-winning performances from this year
    When I create a new ceremony event "Annual Awards Night"
    And I set the date to "2023-12-15"
    And I select medal-winning performances to recognize
    Then the ceremony should be created successfully
    And invited athletes should receive notifications
    And I should be able to track RSVPs

  Scenario: Generate recognition certificates
    Given I have planned a ceremony for medal winners
    When I generate certificates for the ceremony
    Then each medal winner should get an appropriate certificate
    And certificates should include athlete name, achievement, and date
    And certificates should be available for download and printing
```

### Scenario 2: Achievement Showcase

```gherkin
  Scenario: Display recent medal winners
    Given there are recent medal-winning performances
    When I access the achievement showcase
    Then I should see the latest medal winners prominently displayed
    And each achievement should show athlete name, discipline, and medal type
    And I should be able to click through to see performance details

  Scenario: Create achievement wall
    Given I want to create a digital achievement wall
    When I select achievements to showcase
    Then I should be able to arrange them in an attractive display
    And I should be able to include photos of athletes and ceremonies
    And the wall should be suitable for public viewing
```

### Scenario 3: Recognition Status Tracking

```gherkin
  Scenario: Track unrecognized achievements
    Given there are athletes with medal-winning performances
    When I view the recognition dashboard
    Then I should see which achievements haven't been formally recognized
    And I should see how long achievements have been awaiting recognition
    And I should be able to mark achievements as recognized after ceremonies

  Scenario: Recognition history
    Given I have conducted multiple recognition ceremonies
    When I view the recognition history
    Then I should see all past ceremonies with dates and attendees
    And I should see which achievements were recognized at each ceremony
    And I should be able to access photos and documents from each event
```

### Scenario 4: Integration with Performance Data

```gherkin
  Scenario: Link ceremonies to performance records
    Given an athlete won a Gold medal in a performance
    When I include that achievement in a ceremony
    Then the performance record should be linked to the ceremony
    And the performance should show "Recognized at Annual Awards 2023"
    And the ceremony should show the specific performance details

  Scenario: Automatic recognition suggestions
    Given there are new medal-winning performances
    When I plan a new ceremony
    Then the system should suggest recent unrecognized achievements

## Notes

This maintains the vertical slice approach while avoiding duplication of functionality.
