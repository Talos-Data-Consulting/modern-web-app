# User Story 10: Bulk Athlete Upload

**Priority**: Medium (Administrative Feature)
**Epic**: Administrative Tools
**Story Points**: 8

## User Story

As a **staff member or club administrator**, I want to **upload athletes in bulk via CSV** so that I can **efficiently manage large athlete rosters and import data from external systems**.

## Business Value

- Enables efficient management of large athlete rosters
- Supports data migration from external systems
- Reduces manual data entry effort and errors
- Facilitates club setup and roster management

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: CSV Template Download

- **Given** I am a staff user
- **When** I access the bulk athlete upload feature
- **Then** I should be able to download a CSV template
- **And** the template should include all required columns (first_name, last_name, gender)
- **And** the template should include example data for guidance
- **And** the template should be properly formatted for easy completion

### AC2: CSV File Upload and Validation

- **Given** I have prepared a CSV file with athlete data
- **When** I upload the file
- **Then** the system should validate the file format and structure
- **And** the system should validate all athlete data according to business rules
- **And** I should see a validation report with any errors or warnings
- **And** valid data should be highlighted for confirmation

### AC3: Data Preview and Confirmation

- **Given** I have uploaded a valid CSV file
- **When** the validation is complete
- **Then** I should see a preview of all athletes to be created
- **And** I should see validation status for each athlete
- **And** I should be able to review and confirm the data before import
- **And** I should be able to cancel the import if needed

### AC4: Bulk Creation with Error Handling

- **Given** I confirm the athlete data for import
- **When** the bulk creation process runs
- **Then** all valid athletes should be created successfully
- **And** any athletes with errors should be skipped with clear error messages
- **And** I should see a summary of successful and failed creations
- **And** all created athletes should be associated with my current club

### AC5: Duplicate Detection and Handling

- **Given** the CSV contains athletes that may already exist
- **When** the validation runs
- **Then** potential duplicates should be identified and flagged
- **And** I should be able to choose how to handle duplicates (skip, update, or create anyway)
- **And** the system should prevent creation of true duplicates within the same club
- **And** clear guidance should be provided for resolving duplicate conflicts

## BDD Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: CSV Template Download

```gherkin
Feature: Bulk Athlete Upload
  As a staff member
  I want to upload athletes in bulk
  So that I can efficiently manage large rosters

  Scenario: Download CSV template
    Given I am logged in as a staff user
    When I navigate to the "Bulk Upload Athletes" page
    And I click "Download Template"
    Then I should receive a CSV file named "athlete_upload_template.csv"
    And the file should contain headers "first_name,last_name,gender"
    And the file should contain example rows with sample data
    And the gender column should show valid values like "Male" and "Female"
```

### Scenario 2: Valid CSV Upload

```gherkin
  Scenario: Upload valid CSV file
    Given I am on the bulk athlete upload page
    And I have a CSV file with valid athlete data:
      | first_name | last_name | gender |
      | John       | Smith     | Male   |
      | Jane       | Doe       | Female |
      | Mike       | Johnson   | Male   |
    When I upload the CSV file
    Then I should see "File uploaded successfully" message
    And I should see a validation summary showing "3 valid athletes"
    And I should see a preview of all 3 athletes
    And each athlete should show as "Valid" in the preview
```

### Scenario 3: CSV Validation Errors

```gherkin
  Scenario: Handle CSV with validation errors
    Given I upload a CSV file with invalid data:
      | first_name | last_name | gender   |
      | John       | Smith     | Male     |
      |            | Doe       | Female   |
      | Mike       | Johnson   | Invalid  |
    When the validation completes
    Then I should see "1 valid athlete, 2 errors" in the summary
    And I should see "First name is required" error for row 2
    And I should see "Invalid gender" error for row 3
    And "John Smith" should be marked as valid
    And I should be able to download an error report
```

### Scenario 4: Duplicate Detection

```gherkin
  Scenario: Detect potential duplicates
    Given there is already an athlete "John Smith" in my club
    And I upload a CSV containing:
      | first_name | last_name | gender |
      | John       | Smith     | Male   |
      | Jane       | Doe       | Female |
    When the validation runs
    Then I should see "1 potential duplicate detected"
    And "John Smith" should be flagged as a potential duplicate
    And I should see options to "Skip", "Update", or "Create Anyway"
    And "Jane Doe" should be marked as valid for creation
```

### Scenario 5: Bulk Creation Process

```gherkin
  Scenario: Successfully create athletes in bulk
    Given I have uploaded and validated a CSV with 3 valid athletes
    When I click "Create Athletes"
    Then I should see a progress indicator
    And all 3 athletes should be created successfully
    And I should see "3 athletes created successfully" message
    And all athletes should be associated with my current club
    And I should be redirected to the athletes list

  Scenario: Partial success with some errors
    Given I have a mix of valid and invalid athlete data
    When I proceed with the bulk creation
    Then valid athletes should be created successfully
    And invalid athletes should be skipped
    And I should see "2 athletes created, 1 skipped due to errors"
    And I should see detailed error information for skipped athletes
```

### Scenario 6: File Format Validation

```gherkin
  Scenario: Reject invalid file formats
    Given I am on the bulk upload page
    When I try to upload a non-CSV file (e.g., .xlsx or .txt)
    Then I should see "Please upload a CSV file" error
    And the file should not be processed

  Scenario: Handle malformed CSV
    Given I upload a CSV file with missing headers
    When the system processes the file
    Then I should see "Invalid CSV format" error
    And I should see "Required headers: first_name, last_name, gender"
    And the file should not be processed

  Scenario: Handle empty CSV file
    Given I upload an empty CSV file
    When the system processes the file
    Then I should see "CSV file is empty" error
    And no athletes should be processed
```

### Scenario 7: Large File Handling

```gherkin
  Scenario: Handle large CSV files
    Given I upload a CSV file with 1000 athletes
    When the validation process runs
    Then I should see a progress indicator
    And the validation should complete within reasonable time
    And I should see "1000 athletes processed" in the summary

  Scenario: File size limits
    Given I try to upload a CSV file larger than the size limit
    When I submit the upload
    Then I should see "File size exceeds limit" error
    And the file should not be processed
```

### Scenario 8: Permission and Security

```gherkin
  Scenario: Staff user can access bulk upload
    Given I am logged in as a staff user
    When I navigate to athlete management
    Then I should see "Bulk Upload Athletes" option
    And I should be able to access the upload interface

  Scenario: Regular user cannot access bulk upload
    Given I am logged in as a regular user
    When I try to access the bulk upload page
    Then I should see "Permission denied" error
    And I should be redirected to the home page

  Scenario: Anonymous user cannot access bulk upload
    Given I am not logged in
    When I try to access the bulk upload URL directly
    Then I should be redirected to the login page
```

### Scenario 9: Club Context and Data Isolation

```gherkin
  Scenario: Athletes created in correct club context
    Given I am working with "Springfield Athletics Club"
    When I upload and create athletes via CSV
    Then all created athletes should belong to "Springfield Athletics Club"
    And they should not be visible to other clubs

  Scenario: Switch clubs during upload process
    Given I start an upload process with "Springfield Athletics Club"
    And I switch to "Riverside Track Club" during the process
    When I complete the upload
    Then the athletes should be created in "Springfield Athletics Club"
    And the club context should remain consistent throughout the process
```

### Scenario 10: Error Recovery and User Guidance

```gherkin
  Scenario: Clear error messages and guidance
    Given I upload a CSV with various types of errors
    When I view the validation results
    Then each error should have a clear, specific message
    And I should see suggestions for fixing each error
    And I should be able to download the original file with error annotations

  Scenario: Retry after fixing errors
    Given I uploaded a CSV with errors
    And I downloaded the error report
    When I fix the errors and upload the corrected file
    Then the validation should pass
    And I should be able to proceed with creation
