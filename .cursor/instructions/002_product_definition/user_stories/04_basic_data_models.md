# User Story 04: Basic Data Models Setup

**Priority**: Critical (Foundation)
**Epic**: Core System Foundation
**Story Points**: 8

## User Story

As a **system administrator**, I want to **establish the core data models and reference data** so that I can **provide the foundational structure for athletics club management**.

## Business Value

- Provides the database foundation for all system features
- Ensures data integrity and consistency
- Supports multi-club architecture requirements
- Enables standardized athletics data management

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Gender Management

- **Given** the system needs to categorize athletes and performances
- **When** gender data is required
- **Then** the system should support Male and Female genders
- **And** each gender should have a full name and single-character initial
- **And** gender data should be consistent across all features

### AC2: Season Management

- **Given** athletics competitions occur in different seasons
- **When** organizing disciplines and performances
- **Then** the system should support multiple seasons (Track & Field, Indoors, etc.)
- **And** seasons should be global across all clubs
- **And** seasons should be used to organize disciplines

### AC3: Medal System

- **Given** competitions award medals for different positions
- **When** recording competition results
- **Then** the system should support positions 1-12
- **And** position 1 should be Gold, position 2 Silver, position 3 Bronze
- **And** positions 4-12 should be Bronze (for cross-country events)
- **And** medal positions should be unique and properly ordered

### AC4: Age Group Management

- **Given** athletics competitions are organized by age groups
- **When** clubs need to categorize athletes and performances
- **Then** each club should be able to define their own age groups
- **And** age groups should have names like U9, U10, U11, Junior, Senior, Masters
- **And** age groups should have ordinal values for proper sorting
- **And** age groups should be unique within each club

### AC5: Data Integrity

- **Given** the system manages critical athletics data
- **When** any data is created or modified
- **Then** all business rules and constraints should be enforced
- **And** referential integrity should be maintained
- **And** unique constraints should prevent duplicate data

## Technical Requirements

### System References

- **Data Models**: `02_data_models.md` - Complete data model specifications
- **Business Rules**: `05_business_rules.md` - Data validation and integrity rules
- **System Architecture**: `04_system_architecture.md` - Database design principles

### Implementation Details

- Django models with appropriate field types and constraints
- Database migrations for schema creation
- Model validation methods for business rules
- Admin interface configuration for data management
- Seed data management commands

### Database Requirements

- Gender table with name and initial fields
- Season table with unique season names
- Medal table with position and name fields
- AgeGroup table with club relationship and ordinal ordering
- Proper indexes for performance optimization
- Foreign key constraints for referential integrity

## BDD Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Gender Data Management

```gherkin
Feature: Basic Data Models
  As a system administrator
  I want to manage core reference data
  So that the system has proper foundational data

  Scenario: Gender data setup
    Given the system is initialized
    When I check the available genders
    Then I should see "Male" with initial "M"
    And I should see "Female" with initial "F"
    And gender names should be unique
    And gender initials should be unique

  Scenario: Gender data validation
    Given I try to create a duplicate gender
    When I attempt to save a gender with name "Male"
    Then I should get a validation error
    And the duplicate should not be saved
```

### Scenario 2: Season Management

```gherkin
  Scenario: Season data setup
    Given the system is initialized
    When I check the available seasons
    Then I should see "Track & Field" season
    And I should see "Indoors" season
    And season names should be unique

  Scenario: Season data validation
    Given I try to create a season with a duplicate name
    When I attempt to save a season named "Track & Field"
    Then I should get a validation error
    And the duplicate should not be saved
```

### Scenario 3: Medal System

```gherkin
  Scenario: Medal positions setup
    Given the system is initialized
    When I check the available medals
    Then I should see position 1 as "Gold"
    And I should see position 2 as "Silver"
    And I should see position 3 as "Bronze"
    And I should see positions 4-12 as "Bronze"
    And medal positions should be unique

  Scenario: Medal ordering
    Given medals are configured in the system
    When I retrieve medals ordered by position
    Then they should be in ascending order from 1 to 12
    And position 1 should come first
    And position 12 should come last
```

### Scenario 4: Age Group Management

```gherkin
  Scenario: Club-specific age groups
    Given I have "Springfield Athletics Club" selected
    When I create age groups for this club
    Then I should be able to create "U9" with ordinal 1
    And I should be able to create "U10" with ordinal 2
    And I should be able to create "Senior" with ordinal 20
    And each age group should be associated with the club

  Scenario: Age group uniqueness within club
    Given I have "Springfield Athletics Club" selected
    And I have already created an "U9" age group
    When I try to create another "U9" age group for the same club
    Then I should get a validation error
    And the duplicate should not be saved

  Scenario: Age group isolation between clubs
    Given I have "U9" age group in "Springfield Athletics Club"
    When I switch to "Riverside Track Club"
    Then I should be able to create a new "U9" age group for this club
    And it should be separate from the Springfield club's "U9"
```

### Scenario 5: Data Integrity Enforcement

```gherkin
  Scenario: Foreign key constraints
    Given I have reference data in the system
    When I try to delete a gender that is used by athletes
    Then I should get a constraint violation error
    And the gender should not be deleted

  Scenario: Unique constraints
    Given I have existing reference data
    When I try to create duplicate entries
    Then I should get appropriate validation errors
    And the duplicates should not be saved
```

### Scenario 6: Seed Data Management

```gherkin
  Scenario: Initial data setup
    Given I have a fresh system installation
    When I run the seed data command
    Then all standard genders should be created
    And all standard seasons should be created
    And all standard medals should be created
    And the system should be ready for club-specific configuration

  Scenario: Seed data idempotency
    Given I have already run the seed data command
    When I run the seed data command again
    Then no duplicate data should be created
    And existing data should remain unchanged
```
