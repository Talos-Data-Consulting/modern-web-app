### **Step 6: Test Release (Level 3 - Full Validation)**

```powershell
npm run test:all                # Complete unit + E2E tests
npm run validate:pre-docker     # Full validation pipeline
```

### **Step 6.5: Docker Deployment Validation**

```powershell
# Deploy to Docker and validate UI components functionality
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps              # Verify all containers are running
docker-compose logs web --tail=50  # Check for deployment errors

# Validate club selector UI in containerized environment
curl http://localhost:3000 -I  # Test application loads with UI components
# Manual validation: Open browser at http://localhost:3000
# Manual validation: Verify club selector renders in navigation
# Manual validation: Test club switching functionality
# Manual validation: Check responsive design on different screen sizes

# Check for component rendering issues
docker-compose logs web | grep -i "error\|hydration\|rendering" | head -10

# Clean up Docker environment
docker-compose down
```

### **Step 7: Create PR & Merge**

```powershell
# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feat/iteration4-club-selector-ui

# Create PR with detailed description
gh pr create --title "feat(ui): implement club selector component with navigation integration" --body "Adds club selector dropdown, club switching UI, and navigation integration with responsive design"

# After review and approval, update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feat/iteration4-club-selector-ui
```

### **Step 8: Update Progress Tracking**

```powershell
# Update execution plan with Iteration 4 completion
# Mark Iteration 4 as completed in progress dashboard
# Update overall progress from 60% to 80% (4 of 5 iterations)
# Update current iteration status to show Iteration 5 as next
# Update last session date and status
```

## **üìã ITERATION 4 IMPLEMENTATION**

**Rule Reference**: `nextjs-structure-standards.mdc`, `ui-tailwind-css-standards.mdc`

# üöÄ **ITERATION 6: DATA ISOLATION MIDDLEWARE**

**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Completed

## **ITERATION OVERVIEW**

Implement data isolation middleware to enforce club-based filtering across all API endpoints and integrate club context validation throughout the application.

**Duration Estimate**: 30 minutes in single session
**Dependencies**: Iteration 5 (UI Components)
**Scope**: Simple middleware extension for automatic club-based data filtering

## **üîÑ STRICT ITERATION WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Branch & Pull Latest**

```powershell
# Always start with fresh main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/iteration6-data-isolation-middleware
```

### **Step 2: Develop (Initial)**

- Create club context middleware for API routes
- Implement automatic club filtering in database queries
- Add club validation to existing endpoints
- **DO NOT write tests yet** - focus on implementation first

### **Step 3: Test (Level 1 - Immediate Feedback)**

```powershell
npm run quality:check  # Lint + format + type check
npm run test:run       # Quick unit test execution (existing tests only)
```

### **Step 4: Develop (Refine)**

- Update existing API routes to respect club context
- Add club-based authorization checks
- Implement comprehensive error handling for unauthorized access
- **Write comprehensive unit tests** for the new functionality
- Follow existing test patterns in the project (Vitest, React Testing Library)
- Achieve 100% test coverage for new code

### **Step 5: Test (Level 2 - Integration Validation)**

```powershell
npm run test:coverage  # Unit tests with coverage
npm run build          # Verify compilation
```

### **Step 6: Test Release (Level 3 - Full Validation)**

```powershell
npm run test:all                # Complete unit + E2E tests
npm run validate:pre-docker     # Full validation pipeline
```

### **Step 6.5: Docker Deployment Validation**

```powershell
# Deploy to Docker and validate complete end-to-end functionality
docker-compose up --build -d
docker-compose ps              # Verify all containers are running
docker-compose logs web --tail=50  # Check for deployment errors

# Validate complete club management functionality in containerized environment
curl http://localhost:3000 -I  # Test application loads
# Manual validation: Complete end-to-end test
# Manual validation: Sign in as different users
# Manual validation: Verify club context switching works
# Manual validation: Confirm data isolation between clubs
# Manual validation: Test unauthorized club access is blocked

# Test API security and data isolation
curl http://localhost:3000/api/clubs -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]"
curl http://localhost:3000/api/clubs/select -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"clubId":"unauthorized"}'

# Performance validation
docker-compose logs web | grep -i "performance\|slow\|timeout" | head -10

# Clean up Docker environment
docker-compose down
```

### **Step 7: Create PR & Merge**

```powershell
# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feat/iteration5-data-isolation-middleware

# Create PR with detailed description
gh pr create --title "feat(middleware): implement club data isolation and security validation" --body "Adds middleware for club-based data filtering, authorization checks, and complete integration of club context throughout the application"

# After review and approval, update main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feat/iteration5-data-isolation-middleware
```

### **Step 8: Update Progress Tracking**

```powershell
# Update execution plan with Iteration 5 completion
# Mark Iteration 5 as completed in progress dashboard
# Update overall progress from 80% to 100% (5 of 5 iterations)
# Update current iteration status to show project as COMPLETED
# Update last session date and final status
# Mark entire club management feature as production-ready
```

## **üìã ITERATION 5 IMPLEMENTATION**

## üìö **APPENDIX: SESSION MANAGEMENT**

### **Starting a New Session**

1. **Context Recovery**: Read progress dashboard and identify current iteration
2. **Git Status Check**: Verify branch and working directory status
3. **Status Check**: Update iteration checkboxes based on actual completion
4. **Environment Verification**: Run `npm run quality:check` for quick validation
5. **Iteration Identification**: Find next uncompleted iteration

### **Iteration Workflow (Per Session)**

1. **Branch & Pull** ‚Üí Start fresh from main: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. **Create Branch** ‚Üí `git checkout -b feat/iterationX-feature-name`
3. **Develop** ‚Üí Implement initial feature functionality
4. **Test L1** ‚Üí `npm run quality:check && npm run test:run`
5. **Develop** ‚Üí Refine based on immediate feedback
6. **Test L2** ‚Üí `npm run test:coverage && npm run build`
7. **Test L3** ‚Üí `npm run test:all && npm run validate:pre-docker`
8. **Docker Validation** ‚Üí `docker-compose up --build -d` + feature validation
9. **Create PR** ‚Üí Push branch and create detailed pull request
10. **Update Progress** ‚Üí Mark iteration as completed

### **Quality Gates (4-Level Testing Pyramid)**

- **Level 1**: Immediate feedback (quality:check, test:run)
- **Level 2**: Integration validation (test:coverage, build)
- **Level 3**: Release readiness (test:all, validate:pre-docker)
- **Level 4**: Docker deployment validation (containerized environment testing)

### **Emergency Recovery**

If issues occur during an iteration:

1. Check git status: `git status && git log --oneline -5`
2. Review test failures: Check npm script output logs
3. Run regression check: `npm run test:all` to verify no breaking changes
4. Consult specific rule documentation for guidance
5. Rollback to iteration start if needed: `git checkout main && git branch -D current-branch`

### **Session Continuity Rules**

- Each iteration should complete in a single session (2-4 hours)
- If incomplete, document exact stopping point in progress dashboard
- Always end sessions with a clean git state (committed or stashed)
- Next session starts with fresh main pull and context recovery

### **Acceptance Criteria Validation**

After completing all iterations, verify these user story acceptance criteria:

**AC1: Club Context Establishment**

- [ ] Single club users have club automatically selected
- [ ] All data is filtered to user's club context

**AC2: Multi-Club Selection**

- [ ] Multi-club users see club selector interface
- [ ] Users can choose which club to work with
- [ ] Selection is remembered in session

**AC3: Club Context Switching**

- [ ] Users can switch between clubs via selector
- [ ] Session updates with new club context
- [ ] Page reloads with new club data

**AC4: Data Isolation**

- [ ] Users only see data from current club
- [ ] No access to other clubs' data

**AC5: Session Persistence**

- [ ] Club context persists across page navigation
- [ ] Context remains until explicitly changed or logout
