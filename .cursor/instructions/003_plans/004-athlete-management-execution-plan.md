### **Quality Gates (4-Level Testing Pyramid)**

- **Level 1**: Immediate feedback (quality:check, test:run) - existing tests only
- **Level 2**: Integration validation (test:coverage, build) - including new tests
- **Level 3**: Release readiness (test:all, validate:pre-docker) - full suite
- **Level 4**: Docker deployment validation - containerized environment testing

### **Emergency Recovery**

If issues occur during an iteration:

1. **Git Status**: `git status && git log --oneline -5`
2. **Test Status**: Check which test level failed and review output
3. **Database Status**: Verify migrations and seed data integrity
4. **Rollback**: `git checkout main && git branch -D current-branch` if needed
5. **Fresh Start**: Begin iteration again with clean state

### **Session Continuity Rules**

- Each iteration should complete in single session (2-4 hours maximum)
- Always end sessions with clean git state (committed or stashed)
- Update progress dashboard before ending sessions
- Next session starts with fresh main pull and context recovery
- Document any blocking issues in progress dashboard

### **Rule Reference Quick Guide**

- **API**: `typescript-nextjs-standards.mdc`, `nextjs-structure-standards.mdc`
- **UI**: `ui-tailwind-css-standards.mdc`, `dashboard-ui-patterns.mdc`
- **Testing**: `bp-testing-standards.mdc`, `playwright-testing-standards.mdc`

- **Git**: `git-standards.mdc`

### **Playwright Testing Standards Integration**

**Applied to all UI iterations (1C, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4):**

**Core Principles from `playwright-testing-standards.mdc`:**

- **Incremental Development**: Write ONE test at a time, debug before proceeding
- **Semantic Locators**: Use `getByRole()`, `getByLabel()`, `getByText()` exclusively
- **Page Object Models**: Create POMs for AuthPage, ClubPage, AgeGroupPage, AthletePages
- **No Arbitrary Timeouts**: Use proper Playwright waiting strategies
- **Debug-First Approach**: Use `--debug` and `--ui` modes for development

**Development Process for E2E Tests:**

1. Write ONE test skeleton with basic navigation
2. Run with `npx playwright test --grep "test name" --debug`
3. Add ONE interaction (form fill, button click, etc.)
4. Debug and verify before adding next interaction
5. Build up complete workflows incrementally

**Page Object Model Structure:**

```typescript
// Example from standards - apply to all athlete management POMs
export class AthleteCreationPage {
  constructor(private page: Page) {}

  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto('/athletes/new');
    await expect(this.page).toHaveURL(/athletes\/new/);
  }

  async fillAthleteForm(firstName: string, lastName: string, gender: string) {
    await this.page
      .getByRole('textbox', { name: 'First Name' })
      .fill(firstName);
    await this.page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Last Name' }).fill(lastName);
    await this.page
      .getByRole('combobox', { name: 'Gender' })
      .selectOption(gender);
  }

  async submitForm() {
    await this.page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Create Athlete' }).click();
    await expect(
      this.page.getByText('Athlete created successfully')
    ).toBeVisible();
  }
}
```

**Semantic Locator Examples for Athlete Management:**

- Forms: `page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'First Name' })`
- Buttons: `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Create Athlete' })`
- Navigation: `page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Athletes' })`
- Search: `page.getByRole('searchbox', { name: 'Search athletes' })`
- Filters: `page.getByRole('combobox', { name: 'Filter by gender' })`
- Tables: `page.getByRole('cell', { name: 'John Doe' })`

## üìã **DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS**

### **1. ClubContext Integration Patterns**

**Existing Pattern to Follow:**

```typescript
// From existing ClubSelector.tsx - use this pattern
const { selectedClub, userClubs, isLoading, error, selectClub } = useClub();

// Apply to all athlete components:
// - AthleteForm: Use selectedClub.id for automatic club assignment
// - AthleteList: Filter athletes by selectedClub.id
// - AthleteSearch: Limit search results to selectedClub.id
// - AgeGroupAdmin: Manage age groups for selectedClub.id only
```

**Component Integration Requirements:**

- All athlete components MUST use `useClub()` hook from existing ClubContext
- Automatic club filtering applied to all data operations
- No manual club selection - always use currently selected club
- Error handling patterns match existing ClubSelector component

### **3. Staff Permission Integration Specifications**

**Permission Check Implementation:**

```typescript
// src/lib/permissions.ts - Create this utility
import { UserClub, ClubRole } from '@prisma/client';

export const canManageAgeGroups = (userRole: ClubRole): boolean => {
  return userRole === 'ADMIN' || userRole === 'OWNER';
};

export const canCreateAthletes = (userRole: ClubRole): boolean => {
  return userRole === 'ADMIN' || userRole === 'OWNER' || userRole === 'MEMBER';
};
```

**API Integration Pattern:**

```typescript
// Use existing getUserClubRole pattern from db.ts
const userRole = await getUserClubRole(userId, clubId);
if (!canManageAgeGroups(userRole)) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Insufficient permissions' },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

**UI Permission Integration:**

- Age group administration pages: Check ADMIN/OWNER roles only
- Athlete creation: Available to all authenticated club members
- Use existing authentication patterns from ClubSelector

### **4. Seed Data Implementation Details**

**prisma/seed.js Modifications:**

```javascript
// Add to existing seed.js file
async function seedGenderData() {
  console.log('üå± Seeding Gender data...');

  // Create Gender entries with proper constraints
  const maleGender = await prisma.gender.upsert({
    where: { name: 'Male' },
    update: {},
    create: {
      name: 'Male',
      initial: 'M',
    },
  });

  const femaleGender = await prisma.gender.upsert({
    where: { name: 'Female' },
    update: {},
    create: {
      name: 'Female',
      initial: 'F',
    },
  });

  console.log('‚úÖ Gender data seeded successfully');
  return { maleGender, femaleGender };
}

// Add to main seed function
async function main() {
  // ... existing seed code ...

  // Add gender seeding
  await seedGenderData();

  // ... rest of existing seed code ...
}
```

**Migration Commands for Development:**

```powershell
# Generate migration after schema changes
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-athlete-management-models

# Reset and reseed database (development only)
npx prisma migrate reset --force

# Run seed explicitly
npm run db:seed

# Check migration status
npx prisma migrate status
```

**Database Migration Workflow:**

1. **Iteration 1**: Generate migration for Gender and AgeGroup models
2. **Iteration 2**: Generate migration for Athlete model with foreign keys
3. **Each Iteration**: Verify migration runs successfully before proceeding
4. **Rollback Plan**: Use `npx prisma migrate reset` if iteration fails

### **Implementation Verification Checklist**
