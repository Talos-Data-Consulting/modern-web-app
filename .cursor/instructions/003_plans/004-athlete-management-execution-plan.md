## üìö **APPENDIX: SESSION MANAGEMENT**

### **Starting a New Session**

1. **Context Recovery**: Check progress dashboard and identify current iteration
2. **Git Status Check**: `git status && git branch` to verify state
3. **Environment Verification**: `npm run quality:check` for quick validation
4. **Database Status**: Check if migrations are up to date
5. **Iteration Identification**: Find next uncompleted iteration and resume at appropriate step

### **Iteration Workflow (Per Session)**

1. **Branch & Pull** ‚Üí `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. **Create Branch** ‚Üí `git checkout -b feat/iterationXX-feature-name` (e.g., iteration1a, iteration2b)
3. **Develop (Initial)** ‚Üí Core functionality implementation
4. **Test L1** ‚Üí `npm run quality:check && npm run test:run`
5. **Develop (Refine)** ‚Üí Add tests and refined functionality
6. **Test L2** ‚Üí `npm run test:coverage && npm run build`
7. **Test L3** ‚Üí `npm run test:all && npm run validate:pre-docker`
8. **Docker Validation** ‚Üí `docker-compose up --build -d` + feature testing
9. **Create PR** ‚Üí Push branch and create detailed pull request
10. **Update Progress** ‚Üí Mark iteration completed in dashboard

### **Quality Gates (4-Level Testing Pyramid)**

- **Level 1**: Immediate feedback (quality:check, test:run) - existing tests only
- **Level 2**: Integration validation (test:coverage, build) - including new tests
- **Level 3**: Release readiness (test:all, validate:pre-docker) - full suite
- **Level 4**: Docker deployment validation - containerized environment testing

### **Emergency Recovery**

If issues occur during an iteration:

1. **Git Status**: `git status && git log --oneline -5`
2. **Test Status**: Check which test level failed and review output
3. **Database Status**: Verify migrations and seed data integrity
4. **Rollback**: `git checkout main && git branch -D current-branch` if needed
5. **Fresh Start**: Begin iteration again with clean state

### **Session Continuity Rules**

- Each iteration should complete in single session (2-4 hours maximum)
- Always end sessions with clean git state (committed or stashed)
- Update progress dashboard before ending sessions
- Next session starts with fresh main pull and context recovery
- Document any blocking issues in progress dashboard

## üìã **DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATIONS**

### **1. ClubContext Integration Patterns**

**Existing Pattern to Follow:**

```typescript
// From existing ClubSelector.tsx - use this pattern
const { selectedClub, userClubs, isLoading, error, selectClub } = useClub();

// Apply to all athlete components:
// - AthleteForm: Use selectedClub.id for automatic club assignment
// - AthleteList: Filter athletes by selectedClub.id
// - AthleteSearch: Limit search results to selectedClub.id
// - AgeGroupAdmin: Manage age groups for selectedClub.id only
```

**Component Integration Requirements:**

- All athlete components MUST use `useClub()` hook from existing ClubContext
- Automatic club filtering applied to all data operations
- No manual club selection - always use currently selected club
- Error handling patterns match existing ClubSelector component

### **3. Staff Permission Integration Specifications**

**Permission Check Implementation:**

```typescript
// src/lib/permissions.ts - Create this utility
import { UserClub, ClubRole } from '@prisma/client';

export const canManageAgeGroups = (userRole: ClubRole): boolean => {
  return userRole === 'ADMIN' || userRole === 'OWNER';
};

export const canCreateAthletes = (userRole: ClubRole): boolean => {
  return userRole === 'ADMIN' || userRole === 'OWNER' || userRole === 'MEMBER';
};
```

**API Integration Pattern:**

```typescript
// Use existing getUserClubRole pattern from db.ts
const userRole = await getUserClubRole(userId, clubId);
if (!canManageAgeGroups(userRole)) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Insufficient permissions' },
    { status: 403 }
  );
}
```

**UI Permission Integration:**

- Age group administration pages: Check ADMIN/OWNER roles only
- Athlete creation: Available to all authenticated club members
- Use existing authentication patterns from ClubSelector

### **4. Seed Data Implementation Details**

**prisma/seed.js Modifications:**

```javascript
// Add to existing seed.js file
async function seedGenderData() {
  console.log('üå± Seeding Gender data...');

  // Create Gender entries with proper constraints
  const maleGender = await prisma.gender.upsert({
    where: { name: 'Male' },
    update: {},
    create: {
      name: 'Male',
      initial: 'M',
    },
  });

  const femaleGender = await prisma.gender.upsert({
    where: { name: 'Female' },
    update: {},
    create: {
      name: 'Female',
      initial: 'F',
    },
  });

  console.log('‚úÖ Gender data seeded successfully');
  return { maleGender, femaleGender };
}

// Add to main seed function
async function main() {
  // ... existing seed code ...

  // Add gender seeding
  await seedGenderData();

  // ... rest of existing seed code ...
}
```

**Migration Commands for Development:**

```powershell
# Generate migration after schema changes
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-athlete-management-models

# Reset and reseed database (development only)
npx prisma migrate reset --force

# Run seed explicitly
npm run db:seed

# Check migration status
npx prisma migrate status
```

**Database Migration Workflow:**

1. **Iteration 1**: Generate migration for Gender and AgeGroup models
2. **Iteration 2**: Generate migration for Athlete model with foreign keys
3. **Each Iteration**: Verify migration runs successfully before proceeding
4. **Rollback Plan**: Use `npx prisma migrate reset` if iteration fails

### **Implementation Verification Checklist**

**ClubContext Integration:**

- [ ] All components use `useClub()` hook from existing context
- [ ] No manual club selection in athlete components
- [ ] Automatic filtering by `selectedClub.id` in all data operations
- [ ] Error handling matches existing ClubSelector patterns

**Staff Permission Integration:**

- [ ] Age group admin pages restricted to ADMIN/OWNER roles
- [ ] Permission utility functions created and tested
- [ ] API endpoints enforce role-based access control
- [ ] UI components hide/show features based on user role

**Seed Data Implementation:**

- [ ] Gender seed data (Male/M, Female/F) successfully created
- [ ] Upsert patterns prevent duplicate entries on re-seeding
- [ ] Migration commands documented and tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures verified in development environment

**Note**: This execution plan delivers the complete athlete management system through four atomic iterations, each with comprehensive testing and validation. The plan follows enterprise standards and ensures proper integration with existing club management and authentication systems.
