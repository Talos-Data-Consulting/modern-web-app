 * Club Management BDD Test Scenarios
 *
 * These tests validate the 5 Acceptance Criteria for the club management feature:
 * AC1: Club Context Establishment
 * AC2: Multi-Club Selection
 * AC3: Club Context Switching
 * AC4: Data Isolation
 * AC5: Session Persistence
 * 
 * ✅ REFACTORED: Uses new Page Object Models instead of ClubTestHelpers
 * ✅ IMPROVED: Removed arbitrary timeouts and follows Playwright standards
 * ✅ CLEANER: Much more maintainable and reliable tests
